        <p class="uhc2">
          Welcome to the 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Energy,
          Signal Processing, and Cyber Security (iSSSC 2025), hosted by the
          Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Department of
          Electronics and Communication Engineering, GIET University, Gunupur,
          Odisha, India, from November 06-08, 2025. Building on the remarkable
          success of its previous editions, iSSSC 2025 brings together a diverse
          community of academicians, researchers, industry professionals, and
          practitioners under a unified platform to explore advancements and
          challenges in sustainable energy systems, adaptive signal processing,
          and cybersecurity frameworks. This year's symposium expands its focus
          to include the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
          Learning (ML) in modernizing the power and energy industries, enabling
          automation, and strengthening cybersecurity mechanisms.
